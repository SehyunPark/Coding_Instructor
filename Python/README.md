# Intro
• Referenced the [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) course from the University of Michigan, which I took on Coursera(Check [the certificate](https://coursera.org/share/0ee76252b4dc89d2141be9ee58ef03a5)) <br>
<br>
• Personally created class materials, quizzes, some exercises, test questions and some assignments tailored to the students' level <br>
<br>
• Arranged coding contest problems from abroad according to each lesson's topic and made slight modifications <br>

# Objectives

<div align="center", class="python">

| Course Name | Objectives | 
| :--------: | :-----------: |
| Python Applications | • This is an intermediate-level course on creating your first Python GUI program using various libraries such as <b>Tkinter and PySimpleGUI</b>. <br> • Students will learn how to create projects using various libraries and apply and advance their Python knowledge learned in the previous Python Basics classes, ultimately developing sophisticated programs. <br> • Measured students' understanding during the course through quizzes I created myself, and if you enter each student's project folder, their project code is displayed. |
| Python Basics | • This is an introductory course designed for students in the second year of middle school or above who are just starting with Python. <br> • The course covers all essential concepts from A to Z, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the Python programming language. <br> • Through this course, students will grasp the fundamentals of Python, learn how to read code, and gain the ability to create basic programs on their own. <br> • With custom-made teaching materials and quizzes, students will have the opportunity to broaden their knowledge of the Python language. |
| Python(E) Basics | • This is the initial Python learning course designed for elementary school students and first-year middle school students. It serves as their first introduction to programming languages. <br> • Students learn fundamental programming concepts (variables, data types, math operators, if statements and lists) and develop their programming skills by solving various problems (supplementary exercises, quizzes, midterm exams, final exams). |
